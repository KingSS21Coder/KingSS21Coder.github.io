In the coding world, I go by KingSS21, but in real life, I’m Syandan, an aspiring AI engineer. Currently, I’m developing an AI that generates and assists with tutoring for homework and other academic areas. I am currently learning Python to advance my skills in AI. I am also interested in game development, and I have indulged in this interest with my project, HyperSpeed.

Current Programming Languages: Python
